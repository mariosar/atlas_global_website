							<div class="col-sm-4">In the last few years some countries in order to attract foreign investment and boost the economy, governments decided to amend the laws and rules around the legal entry and stay of international citizens in the country. This resulted in the creation of a new system of Investment Based Residence and/or Citizenship Program, commonly known as “Golden Visas”.</div>
							<div class="col-sm-4">There are a few differences from country to country: from the level and type of investment, as well as time and residency requirements. Most clients favour investing in real estate but government bonds and opening a business are also alternatives.</div>
							<div class="col-sm-4">Capital investment varies, from 250.000 Euro in some countries to 2.5 million Euro leading to either permanent residency and/or citizenship.</div>
