							<h3 class="section-heading">Golden Visa Spain</h3>
							<p>The Spanish Golden Visa program reflects much of the impression the world has of its population: straightforward and flexible, however is typically a residency programme since to gain citizenship investors must live in the country.</p>
							<p>The investment in real estate required is a minimum of 500,000 Euro and the property, either residencial or commercial (or both), can be rented out. The Spanish golden visa process is very fast, the application for the residency visa takes only about 15 days and once granted, is valid for two years, which can then be renewed for another fiver years. The government fees are fairly low and we recommend that clients budget around 12% for government and legal fees and relevant conveyancing taxes.</p>
							<p>The Spain golden visa grant investors the right to live in the country but there is no requirement to do so or indeed a minimum stay imposition. The residency card allows free travel within the EU Schengen area. It is possible to gain permanent residency after five years, however the applicant has to spend at least six months of the year living in Spain.</p>
